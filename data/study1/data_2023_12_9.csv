Is it weird to semi-regularly talk to your sister‚Äôs boyfriend?

I‚Äôm tired of explaining this but again tonight my boyfriend said it was weird ‚Äúhow much‚Äù I talk to my sisters boyfriend, we‚Äôll just say K for brevity. First off, we talk like 2-3 times a week and it‚Äôs a few texts that he usually leaves on delivered for days. I‚Äôve known K for like 6 years at this point, even rented an apartment with him and my sister for a bit last year. And I have never, literally never thought about him in any more than a platonic way. I just don‚Äôt see him that way. And the thought of doing anything w him makes my skin crawl. Yet my mother, sister, and my boyfriend have acted suspicious and insinuated I liked him multiple times over the years. I don‚Äôt want to cut someone off that I genuinely enjoy talking to, but I also don‚Äôt want to make my sister or boyfriend uncomfortable by making them feel like I‚Äôm doing something shady.

 

Possible solutions: Block him, don‚Äôt block him, talk even less than we already do. But I feel the problem would remain and I‚Äôd lose a good friend.","Question

Is it unreasonable for me to ask my friend not to smoke weed when we're together? i Simply dislike it. I don't like the smell nor the way she behaves when she's high. also it gets kinda awkward because i don't smoke and she's by herself giggling all the time and we can't do shit cause she's high. before she stared smoking we would do a lot together but now it's just me going to her place (she never comes to mine) and watching her smoke. is it selfish of me to ask her to change her habits when I'm around? be brutally honest.","Question

should I(f32) sue hairdresser for not refunding $140

Long story short, I went into a salon to dye my hair. They said, ""we can dye it that color, no problem, no bleach will be used."" After dyeing it, my hair came out two very different colors. Then they apply something in my hair. I ask what it is and, it's bleach. I express how much I didn't want that and that and how dare they just put it on my hair without telling me even after it was agreed that bleach wouldnt be used etc. They're like, ""oh you'll be fine"" and then proceeded to dye my hair a second time after the bleach. I look like a clown now with different colors on my hair (orange at the root and brownish red at the body). But the worst of it all is that I have bleach in my hair and I'm upset that my hair will never be the same. I will have to keep cutting it until the damaged bleached hair is gone. I have curly hair so my curls will most likely not be the same also.



I wanted a refund for this experience. These stylist did whatever they wanted to me. Bleached my hair and dyed it twice in 1 day. Instead the stylist and the owner start yelling at me telling me they can't refund me and that I'm wasting their time and that the most they could do for me is give me some type of moisturizing treatment the next time I come in. (They are so clueless) I explain that I'm never coming back and leave with damaged hair, orange roots, and redish/brown hair, a lousy blowout, an uneven trim, and the delight of being shouted at by two extremely unprofessional ladies. Not to mention I paid $140 for this nightmare.



I spoke to friends they're all in shock of such an experience and they warn me that in a couple of months, my hair might fall out bc of the bleach üò¢ . I am considering suing this business. What are your thoughts?","Question

I (19) have moved to a city with a big homeless population and walk by homeless people everyday on the way to school, mall, whatever. i always feel super bad and today i gave 20 dollar bills to 2 people separately, 40 dollars each because i just felt bad for them. one women was on the street looking sad and disheveled and she said god bless u which made me happy as someone kinda religious. the other guy had a sign saying he was in a fire and he looked it so i gave him a twenty after debating with myself (i was gonna give a five but felt bad and figured i didn‚Äôt need it). i know this seems like i‚Äôm bad with money maybe? i‚Äôm worried but i figured i would just spend that on weed so i was better off doing this. i don‚Äôt know if this is reckless spending but my parents gave me spending money and i‚Äôm worried they would disprove ig. also i heard ‚Äúreckless spending‚Äù is a result of mental illness and i‚Äôm not sure if this qualifies?","Question

My boyfriend (23m) is a dealer and won‚Äôt get a legal job what do

Hello everyone, I (22f) am having a hard time with my bf (23m). We have been together for almost 6 years, as the title states he is a dealer. I have been trying to encourage him to get a job for years, and he acts like a complete man child about it, he has a temper problem when it comes to any kind of authority over him. Other than that we really don‚Äôt get into disagreements so it makes this harder for me. When we started dating we only did it because it was what we had to do if we wanted food or shelter, but now he‚Äôs became lazy. He just wants fast easy ways to get rich (y‚Äôall don‚Äôt even know how many crypto scams I have prevented him from giving our savings to) and not put in effort for anything he wants in life. Obviously I can‚Äôt just change him and make him work, but idk what to do anymore and I‚Äôm tired of it. To make things worse I‚Äôm a very introverted person and don‚Äôt have any near friends I could just move in with if I decided to leave. I hate saying I‚Äôm with him only for financial reasons because I do really love him, but ultimately if I had the money I would have been gone long ago. He just keeps saying he‚Äôs going to get a job as an ‚Äúentrepreneur‚Äù but as I said he wants everything handed to him with no effort.  Anyways what can or should I do?","Question

My 2nd grade son was involved in a scuffle at recess. Before I even heard anything of it from school, I received an email from the mother of one of the boys involved. At the end of it she threatened to file a police report.bPeople are absolutely insane these days but I laughed and dismissed her bizarre behavior. Didn't reply. Untill one night at 730, a knock on the door to reveal 2 armed patrol officers looking to interrogate my 7 year old son. This psycho really called the cops on a 2nd grader. I'm floored. I'm thinking about going with a Harassment or Restraining Order but what do you all think? If she is so mentally unstable as to call police on a 7 year old, what's she liable to do or say if she ever sees my son around school, for example, and I am not there?

Untill one night at 730, a knock on the door to reveal 2 armed patrol officers looking to interrogate my 7 year old son. This psycho really called the cops on a 2nd grader. I'm floored. I'm thinking about going with a Harassment or Restraining Order but what do you all think? If she is so mentally unstable as to call police on a 7 year old, what's she liable to do or say if she ever sees my son around school, for example, and I am not there?

Why am I still disgusted with my boyfriend

I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for three years now. Honestly when we met I wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship, and I don‚Äôt think he was either.

So when we first met I saw him and I felt disgusted. This overwhelming feeling of disgust‚Ä¶

I ignored it then, as we‚Äôd only just met, but to this day it‚Äôs still there.

There‚Äôs things I‚Äôve grown to love about him, but still underneath this feeling of disgust is there.

Are any teen moms, dads, or parents, in general, able to advise me on caring for a baby at 16?

# I got my girlfriend pregnant and she doesn't want an abortion but neither do I. Im gonna be 16 in about 2 weeks so I can get a decent amount of jobs but pretty low pay. I don't know how my mom is going to react, she could kick me out but I'm not sure. Would it be better to move in with my GF and care for the baby or stay with my mom?

Is it ok to walk away?

Yesterday I was wearing a pullover of my favorite baseball team. At the grocery store. Doing my thing. Minding my business.

This man, a creepy squirrelly type, starts talking to me about the team. He makes zero sense. I can barely understand him and I‚Äôm trying to be polite and saying mmmhmm and walk away. Again. I don‚Äôt know him. I think that‚Äôs generous.

But, he turns his cart around and starts following me to talk more. I end up turning again, because ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care to continue this conversation because I feel he‚Äôs being a little racist. But, I feel he‚Äôs taken advantage of my being nice.

He approaches again an aisle over and continues, at this point, I try an uh-huh and walk off.



In this situation, is it ok to walk off? I don‚Äôt know this person. He‚Äôs a little on the creeper side. I don‚Äôt want trouble. I was just minding my business, shopping.","Question
