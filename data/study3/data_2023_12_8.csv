Is it weird to semi-regularly talk to your sister’s boyfriend?

I’m tired of explaining this but again tonight my boyfriend said it was weird “how much” I talk to my sisters boyfriend, we’ll just say K for brevity. First off, we talk like 2-3 times a week and it’s a few texts that he usually leaves on delivered for days. I’ve known K for like 6 years at this point, even rented an apartment with him and my sister for a bit last year. And I have never, literally never thought about him in any more than a platonic way. I just don’t see him that way. And the thought of doing anything w him makes my skin crawl. Yet my mother, sister, and my boyfriend have acted suspicious and insinuated I liked him multiple times over the years. I don’t want to cut someone off that I genuinely enjoy talking to, but I also don’t want to make my sister or boyfriend uncomfortable by making them feel like I’m doing something shady.

Possible solutions: Block him, don’t block him, talk even less than we already do. But I feel the problem would remain and I’d lose a good friend.





Advice:

It may not be the most ideal situation, but there really isn't anything wrong or ""weird"" about talking to your sister's boyfriend as long as you are only having conversations that are appropriate and platonic in nature. If your family or your boyfriend is still suspicious of your interactions, you could try being more open about why you are talking to him and setting boundaries for your interactions. It's up to you to decide if the friendship is worth maintaining, and if it is, then be sure to communicate that to your family and boyfriend.

Advice:

It is not weird to talk to your sister's boyfriend if there is a genuine friendship and connection between you two that is strictly platonic. You have known him for several years, shared an apartment together, and have a good friendship. As long as both of you are comfortable with the level of communication, there is nothing wrong with it. It is natural for your boyfriend to feel a little insecure or jealous, but if you have reassured him that it is strictly platonic and he trusts you, there should not be a problem. If you feel like you are losing a good friend by blocking or reducing communication, you can have an open and honest conversation with both your sister and your boyfriend to address any concerns they may have and try to reach a mutual understanding.

Advice:

Conversing with your sister's boyfriend, K, can be normal, especially if you have a longstanding bond. But remember to consider the feelings of your boyfriend and sister. The key is open communication. Discuss the situation with those involved, reassuring them that their feelings are important to you. Establish clear boundaries with K and discuss these with your sister and boyfriend to prevent potential misunderstandings.

Involve your sister and boyfriend in your chats with K often, so they can see its platonic nature. Self-reflect on your feelings for K and ensure the relationship remains platonic. Balance is crucial in maintaining harmony among all parties. While it may be challenging, open dialogue and explicit boundaries can help maintain relationships without causing discomfort or suspicion.

Possible solutions: Block him, don’t block him, talk even less than we already do. But I feel the problem would remain and I’d lose a good friend.

No girl, just talk to him normally and make sure to mention in front of others that he’s like family to you. As in “Oh, he’s my brother now” since he’s your sister’s bf. Or “Oh he’s like my family” or “Oh, I see him as my brother” … It’s normal to be close to a friend or family member. And obviously if he’s been around for years, you’ll consider him family at this point. Same way it’s normal for my family, especially grandmas to treat my bf like their grandson now at this point. He’s become family. Nothing wrong with that. And since you yourself have said you don’t see him that way… then nothing wrong with it as long as you set a very clear boundary. In this case the boundary is called publicly “familyzoned”

Is it unreasonable for me to ask my friend not to smoke weed when we're together? i Simply dislike it.

Advice:

No, it is not selfish of you to ask your friend not to smoke weed when you're together. It is perfectly reasonable for you to make your boundaries clear in terms of what kind of behavior you are comfortable with. If your friend values your friendship, she should be willing to respect your preferences when you are together. On the other hand, it would also be reasonable for you to respect that your friend may use weed at times and to be flexible when it comes to spending time with her.

Advice:

It is not selfish of you to ask your friend not to smoke weed when you're together. You have the right to set boundaries in your relationship and express what makes you feel uncomfortable. However, you should approach the conversation with care and respect for your friend's choices.

You could start by explaining how you feel when she smokes weed around you, and how it affects your time together. Be honest but also try to be understanding of her perspective. You could also suggest alternative activities that you both can do together instead of smoking weed.

Ultimately, it is up to your friend whether or not they want to smoke weed when you're together, but it is important that you communicate your feelings and needs in the friendship.

Advice:

Communicating your feelings and preferences concerning shared experiences to your friend is crucial, requiring open and honest dialogue. Should you need guidance initiating this conversation, consider a few points. First, aim for a relaxed setting when your friend is sober, as it makes the dialogue more effective. Be honest yet respectful when describing how her smoking weed affects your time together. Suggest mutually enjoyable, sober activities to help you reconnect and make new memories. Be open to compromises, like asking her to smoke less during your get-togethers, and be prepared for possible concessions. Lastly, reassure her of the importance of your friendship, emphasizing that your intentions are to improve shared experiences. Keep in mind that successful friendships depend on open communication and mutual understanding.

should I(f32) sue hairdresser for not refunding $140

Long story short, I went into a salon to dye my hair. They said, ""we can dye it that color, no problem, no bleach will be used."" After dyeing it, my hair came out two very different colors. Then they apply something in my hair. I ask what it is and, it's bleach. I express how much I didn't want that and that and how dare they just put it on my hair without telling me even after it was agreed that bleach wouldnt be used etc. They're like, ""oh you'll be fine"" and then proceeded to dye my hair a second time after the bleach. I look like a clown now with different colors on my hair (orange at the root and brownish red at the body). But the worst of it all is that I have bleach in my hair and I'm upset that my hair will never be the same. I will have to keep cutting it until the damaged bleached hair is gone. I have curly hair so my curls will most likely not be the same also.



I wanted a refund for this experience. These stylist did whatever they wanted to me. Bleached my hair and dyed it twice in 1 day. Instead the stylist and the owner start yelling at me telling me they can't refund me and that I'm wasting their time and that the most they could do for me is give me some type of moisturizing treatment the next time I come in. (They are so clueless) I explain that I'm never coming back and leave with damaged hair, orange roots, and redish/brown hair, a lousy blowout, an uneven trim, and the delight of being shouted at by two extremely unprofessional ladies. Not to mention I paid $140 for this nightmare.



I spoke to friends they're all in shock of such an experience and they warn me that in a couple of months, my hair might fall out bc of the bleach 😢 . I am considering suing this business. What are your thoughts?



Advice:

Given the magnitude of the issue, you may have a solid case for a lawsuit against the hairdresser. You should consult a lawyer experienced in consumer protection or business law to assess the strength of your argument and advise you on the correct next steps. Even if suing is not a viable option, you may be able to pursue other legal remedies available to you, such as filing a complaint with your state’s department of consumer protection or attorney general’s office. In addition to potential legal recourse, you may also be able to file a complaint with the state board of cosmetology and get the hairdresser in trouble depending on the laws and regulations in your state. This could provide you with a bit of closure, even if it doesn't result in a refund. In any case, it is important to ensure that what happened to you does not happen to anyone else. Take action and keep your receipts as evidence in case you decide to pursue any type of legal remedy.

Instead the stylist and the owner start yelling at me telling me they can't refund me and that I'm wasting their time and that the most they could do for me is give me some type of moisturizing treatment the next time I come in.

Not to mention I paid $140 for this nightmare.



I spoke to friends they're all in shock of such an experience and they warn me that in a couple of months, my hair might fall out bc of the bleach 😢 . I am considering suing this business. What are your thoughts?



Advice:

Given the magnitude of the issue, you may have a solid case for a lawsuit against the hairdresser. You should consult a lawyer experienced in consumer protection or business law to assess the strength of your argument and advise you on the correct next steps. Even if suing is not a viable option, you may be able to pursue other legal remedies available to you, such as filing a complaint with your state’s department of consumer protection or attorney general’s office. In addition to potential legal recourse, you may also be able to file a complaint with the state board of cosmetology and get the hairdresser in trouble depending on the laws and regulations in your state. This could provide you with a bit of closure, even if it doesn't result in a refund. In any case, it is important to ensure that what happened to you does not happen to anyone else. Take action and keep your receipts as evidence in case you decide to pursue any type of legal remedy.

Long story short, I went into a salon to dye my hair. They said, ""we can dye it that color, no problem, no bleach will be used."" After dyeing it, my hair came out two very different colors. Then they apply something in my hair. I ask what it is and, it's bleach. I express how much I didn't want that and that and how dare they just put it on my hair without telling me even after it was agreed that bleach wouldnt be used etc. They're like, ""oh you'll be fine"" and then proceeded to dye my hair a second time after the bleach. I look like a clown now with different colors on my hair (orange at the root and brownish red at the body). But the worst of it all is that I have bleach in my hair and I'm upset that my hair will never be the same. I will have to keep cutting it until the damaged bleached hair is gone. I have curly hair so my curls will most likely not be the same also.

Advice:

It is understandable that you feel frustrated and angry about the experience you had at the salon. However, before you decide to sue, it's important to assess the situation and consider your options. Firstly, you could try to resolve the issue directly with the salon by writing a complaint letter or speaking to the owner/manager. Explain the situation calmly and clearly, and ask for a refund or compensation for the damage done to your hair. It's possible that they may be willing to work with you to find a resolution. If the salon is unresponsive or refuses to offer any compensation, then you might consider taking legal action. However, before you do so, it's important to understand the costs and risks involved. It might end up costing you more in legal fees than the amount you're trying to recover, and there is no guarantee of winning the case. In the end, the most important thing is to take care of your hair and take steps to minimize any damage that may have been done. Consider getting professional advice from a stylist or haircare expert on how to best care for your hair in the aftermath of this experience.

Advice:

Though I can't offer legal advice, I can suggest some steps in dealing with this. Start by recording the damage: take photos of your hair and keep any receipts or records of conversations with the salon. You might also want to get a second opinion from another haircare professional. Reach out to the salon owner to express your dissatisfaction and ask for a refund. Be very clear about how your hair was damaged and the poor service you received. If they refuse, let them know you're considering further action. If you choose to go legal, get acquainted with your local small claims court process. These courts are meant for disputes under a specific amount and the process is usually cheaper and less complicated than a typical lawsuit. You could also meet with a lawyer to evaluate your case and give advice on what to do next. Bear in mind that pursing legal action can be costly and time-consuming, so weigh the possible benefits against the cost and effort. Finally, sharing your experience on social media or review sites could raise awareness and prevent similar situations in future.

Advice:

Wow I'm so sorry you experienced this, that is very unprofessional. Just to calm your anxiety. I have curly hair as well, and have bleached it more than I would like to admit. You will see some breakage at the ends but I can assure you it's not going to fall out. Use a deep conditioning treatment if it seems damaged, gradually trim the ends rather than just cutting it all, there is no reason you should have to lose your length and your money. You could take it to small claims but I feel in the long run it would be worth more of your energy than it's worth. If it is a corporation call and make a complaint about the salon specifically those ladies, we don't need people like that in the industry, they can have their license revoked. I know a lot of people are against doing their hair at home, but I personally do because of an experience similar to this, and I did attend cosmetology school.  Your roots are much lighter because they take bleach the fastest. Go to Sally's get a toner and developer of your shade choice I would recommend like a burgundy shade a little darker than the ends of your hair and just do the roots, it will give you a nice ombre effect. If you do decide to do a dye at home, feel free to reach out with the look you were going for and I can offer more advice and walk you through it.

You will see some breakage at the ends but I can assure you it's not going to fall out. Use a deep conditioning treatment if it seems damaged, gradually trim the ends rather than just cutting it all, there is no reason you should have to lose your length and your money. You could take it to small claims but I feel in the long run it would be worth more of your energy than it's worth. If it is a corporation call and make a complaint about the salon specifically those ladies, we don't need people like that in the industry, they can have their license revoked. I know a lot of people are against doing their hair at home, but I personally do because of an experience similar to this, and I did attend cosmetology school.  Your roots are much lighter because they take bleach the fastest. Go to Sally's get a toner and developer of your shade choice I would recommend like a burgundy shade a little darker than the ends of your hair and just do the roots, it will give you a nice ombre effect. If you do decide to do a dye at home, feel free to reach out with the look you were going for and I can offer more advice and walk you through it.

should I(f32) sue hairdresser for not refunding $140

Long story short, I went into a salon to dye my hair. They said, ""we can dye it that color, no problem, no bleach will be used."" After dyeing it, my hair came out two very different colors. Then they apply something in my hair. I ask what it is and, it's bleach. I express how much I didn't want that and that and how dare they just put it on my hair without telling me even after it was agreed that bleach wouldnt be used etc. They're like, ""oh you'll be fine"" and then proceeded to dye my hair a second time after the bleach. I look like a clown now with different colors on my hair (orange at the root and brownish red at the body). But the worst of it all is that I have bleach in my hair and I'm upset that my hair will never be the same. I will have to keep cutting it until the damaged bleached hair is gone. I have curly hair so my curls will most likely not be the same also.



I wanted a refund for this experience. These stylist did whatever they wanted to me. Bleached my hair and dyed it twice in 1 day. Instead the stylist and the owner start yelling at me telling me they can't refund me and that I'm wasting their time and that the most they could do for me is give me some type of moisturizing treatment the next time I come in. (They are so clueless) I explain that I'm never coming back and leave with damaged hair, orange roots, and redish/brown hair, a lousy blowout, an uneven trim, and the delight of being shouted at by two extremely unprofessional ladies. Not to mention I paid $140 for this nightmare.



I spoke to friends they're all in shock of such an experience and they warn me that in a couple of months, my hair might fall out bc of the bleach 😢 . I am considering suing this business. What are your thoughts?

I am dying, I don’t want people to know. What should I do?

I just started therapy so Reddit is not the only place for this but I am feeling alone. I don’t want to tell people I have less than a year to live. I’m so fucking exhausted. Chemo is horrible. My body is failing me. I have nothing left to live for and I don’t want to be around my crying family and friends. I don’t want anything anymore but to just hurry up and die. Sorry I know it’s morbid but it’s how I feel. Can barely type this. The hospital is depressing and I feel like I’ve done nothing in life worth anything and I’m only in my twenties. How do I feel better again and does it even matter if I do if I’ll be dead soon anyways? Idk anymore



Advice:

I'm so sorry to hear about the struggle that you are going through right now. It sounds like a very difficult and heartbreaking situation, and I can only imagine how hard it must be for you. I would encourage you to talk to a professional - either your therapist or a counsellor or support group - so that you have someone to talk to about what you’re feeling and to get some help in managing this difficult time. It can be incredibly helpful to share your experience and receive support from others who understand what you’re going through. Also, try to keep a sense of perspective about your life and focus on the good moments and memories. Remember that whatever time you do have left, is still precious and meaningful. You are still here for a reason and your life has meaning, no matter how long you get to live it. Try to focus on the positive things in your life and the relationships that you have with the people around you. Finally, remember that you can still make a difference in the time you have left. Think about the things that make you feel better, and the things that you love to do, and find a way to make them a part of your life. Even if it’s something as small as taking a drive to a nearby park, it can make all the difference. Take care of yourself.

Advice:

While I'm not a mental health professional, I can provide suggestions. However, reaching out to a qualified therapist or counselor is crucial. Start by sharing your emotions with someone you trust. Try to focus on the present moment, engage in enjoyable activities, or seek out new hobbies for pleasure and achievement. Connect with support groups or online communities managing similar challenges. Prioritize self-care, maintaining a healthy routine inclusive of sleep, nutrition, and relaxation. Mindfulness techniques like meditation or deep breathing may help manage stress and improve mood. Contemplate your legacy to find a sense of purpose. This could mean sharing your experiences, advising others or spending quality time with loved ones. Remember, a mental health professional is essential for personalized guidance and support tailored to your circumstances.

Advice:

I understand how you feel. I was a terminal cancer patient with no options. I had cancer before but was stage 3, then 10+ years later it came back much much worse. My doctors were fantastic and called all over the country to see if they could find anyone with my specific diagnosis. They found a hospital that had done an experimental procedure 3 times. Out of those one worked, the others passed.  I had 4-6 months left or try this experimental procedure which could be deadly. My family and friends were completely sympathetic but I alone had to deal with my decision either way. I decided to do the experimental procedure. I was scared shitless and consistently depressed. I was heavily medicated for anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn’t get out of my own head for a long time. Fortunately I’ve been in remission for 2 years. The other person who had the procedure and lived has now died. I don’t know how long I have months to 20+ years. I’ve been where you are and I could be again. It’s all a mystery. Please don’t give up and find just one person, even another terminal patient, to talk with. Having a horrible situation in common can be cathartic. Please feel free to message me if you would like to talk. I’m sending you healing and peaceful vibes.

How do I feel better again and does it even matter if I do if I’ll be dead soon anyways? Idk anymore



Advice:

I understand how you feel. I was a terminal cancer patient with no options. I had cancer before but was stage 3, then 10+ years later it came back much much worse. My doctors were fantastic and called all over the country to see if they could find anyone with my specific diagnosis. They found a hospital that had done an experimental procedure 3 times. Out of those one worked, the others passed.  I had 4-6 months left or try this experimental procedure which could be deadly. My family and friends were completely sympathetic but I alone had to deal with my decision either way. I decided to do the experimental procedure. I was scared shitless and consistently depressed. I was heavily medicated for anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn’t get out of my own head for a long time. Fortunately I’ve been in remission for 2 years. The other person who had the procedure and lived has now died. I don’t know how long I have months to 20+ years. I’ve been where you are and I could be again. It’s all a mystery. Please don’t give up and find just one person, even another terminal patient, to talk with. Having a horrible situation in common can be cathartic. Please feel free to message me if you would like to talk. I’m sending you healing and peaceful vibes.

It's great to hear that you have a job at such a young age and are thinking about saving for the future! While it's important to save for big goals, it's also important to enjoy your hard-earned money by spending it on things that bring you joy in the present. Video games can provide a source of entertainment and relaxation, which can be beneficial for your mental health. However, it's important to strike a balance between spending on leisure activities and saving for future needs. One idea is to allocate a certain percentage of your income towards saving and the rest towards discretionary spending. For example, you could save 50% of your income and use the other 50% for fun activities like buying video games or going out with friends. This way, you can enjoy your money now and work towards financial stability in the future. Remember, personal finance is all about balance and finding what works best for you. Keep up the good work with your job and savings goals, and don't forget to have a little fun along the way!

Advice:

It's impressive you're thinking about your finances at this stage. Balancing spending and saving is important. It's okay to spend some funds on things you enjoy, as long as you save for the future. Creating a budget can help manage your money by allocating income for saving, spending, and financial goals. Setting goals, both short-term and long-term, can keep you focused and motivated. Consider the 50/30/20 rule; 50% of income for necessities, 30% for personal spending, and 20% for savings. But remember, you can adjust these numbers according to your needs and ambitions. Set aside 'fun money' for leisure activities, so you can enjoy the present without sacrificing future plans. Learning about personal finance, like budgeting, investing, and debt management, can help shape healthy financial habits. Remember, the right balance between spending and saving depends on your financial goals and priorities. Spending on things that bring you joy is fine, as long as you're also progressing towards your financial goals.

am I (19) silly for giving money away to the homeless?



I (19) have moved to a city with a big homeless population and walk by homeless people everyday on the way to school, mall, whatever. i always feel super bad and today i gave 20 dollar bills to 2 people separately, 40 dollars each because i just felt bad for them. one women was on the street looking sad and disheveled and she said god bless u which made me happy as someone kinda religious. the other guy had a sign saying he was in a fire and he looked it so i gave him a twenty after debating with myself (i was gonna give a five but felt bad and figured i didn’t need it). i know this seems like i’m bad with money maybe? i’m worried but i figured i would just spend that on weed so i was better off doing this. i don’t know if this is reckless spending but my parents gave me spending money and i’m worried they would disprove ig. also i heard “reckless spending” is a result of mental illness and i’m not sure if this qualifies?



Advice:

No, you are not silly for giving money away to the homeless. It shows great kindness and empathy towards those who are in a vulnerable state and who may not have access to the same resources and safety nets as you. Generosity and selflessness are admirable qualities and are important aspects of any society. Of course, if you are concerned about reckless spending, it's best to plan ahead and set a limit for how much money you will donate each month so that you do not overspend.

Advice:

It's kind and generous of you to want to help those in need, but it's important to be aware of the potential risks involved when giving money directly to homeless people. There is no way to guarantee that the money you give will be used in a positive or responsible way, and it's possible that it may contribute to enabling destructive habits such as drug or alcohol abuse. It's also important to consider your own financial situation and responsibilities. While your parents have given you spending money, it's important to budget and prioritize your expenses wisely. Giving money away without considering the potential consequences may not be the most responsible use of your resources. Instead of giving money directly to homeless individuals, you may want to consider donating to a reputable charity organization that works to address homelessness and poverty. This way, you can ensure that your donation goes towards effective and sustainable solutions that help to uplift entire communities. Additionally, volunteering at a local shelter or soup kitchen can provide a more direct way to help those in need while also gaining more insight into the issue of homelessness. In terms of your concerns about recklessness, it's important to be mindful of your financial behavior and seek help if you feel like it's becoming a problem. However, giving to those in need is not necessarily a sign of mental illness - it's a noble and compassionate act. Just be sure to consider the potential risks and use your resources responsibly.

This way, you can ensure that your donation goes towards effective and sustainable solutions that help to uplift entire communities. Additionally, volunteering at a local shelter or soup kitchen can provide a more direct way to help those in need while also gaining more insight into the issue of homelessness. In terms of your concerns about recklessness, it's important to be mindful of your financial behavior and seek help if you feel like it's becoming a problem. However, giving to those in need is not necessarily a sign of mental illness - it's a noble and compassionate act. Just be sure to consider the potential risks and use your resources responsibly.

am I (19) silly for giving money away to the homeless?



I (19) have moved to a city with a big homeless population and walk by homeless people everyday on the way to school, mall, whatever. i always feel super bad and today i gave 20 dollar bills to 2 people separately, 40 dollars each because i just felt bad for them. one women was on the street looking sad and disheveled and she said god bless u which made me happy as someone kinda religious. the other guy had a sign saying he was in a fire and he looked it so i gave him a twenty after debating with myself (i was gonna give a five but felt bad and figured i didn’t need it). i know this seems like i’m bad with money maybe? i’m worried but i figured i would just spend that on weed so i was better off doing this. i don’t know if this is reckless spending but my parents gave me spending money and i’m worried they would disprove ig. also i heard “reckless spending” is a result of mental illness and i’m not sure if this qualifies?

It's kind and generous of you to want to help those in need, but it's important to be aware of the potential risks involved when giving money directly to homeless people. There is no way to guarantee that the money you give will be used in a positive or responsible way, and it's possible that it may contribute to enabling destructive habits such as drug or alcohol abuse. It's also important to consider your own financial situation and responsibilities. While your parents have given you spending money, it's important to budget and prioritize your expenses wisely.

Advice:

Your desire to assist the homeless is commendable. While offering financial aid is one method, it's important to consider your own economic stability. To continue this support responsibly, consider setting a monthly budget for this cause, helping you balance charity with personal financial needs. Other ways to help include volunteering at shelters, donating necessary items like food or clothes, or supporting organizations fighting homelessness. Educating yourself on homelessness can guide your effective support. If you're apprehensive about parental approval, discuss your intentions with them. They could suggest alternative assistance methods. Remember, acts of generosity do not necessarily indicate mental health issues. But if you're worried, consult a professional. The goal is balancing aid to those in need with your financial well-being. Monitor your spending habits and consider other methods to support the homeless.

Advice:

Here's my point of view, as someone who was on the streets for 7 years. I was always grateful regardless if it was 50 cents or 100 bucks that someone would kick down to me. So I'm sure they are grateful and really do appreciate you helping them out. 20 bucks doesn't seem like a lot, but when you're on the streets you can make it go far. Sure I'd buy alcohol, and I was mostly honest about it, (Yo, can you spare some change for alcohol and I promise you I won't buy food) was my line, but most the time I'd buy food lol. So they'll more than likely will be getting their fix or maybe they'll get food, but now when I give back, after the money leaves my hand to theirs it's really none of my business what they spend it on. I normally say ""Get whatever you need"" when I give people money. I personally don't think it's foolish, but at the end of the day you need to be sure you can take care of yourself. Sorry if this makes no sense, was a long day.

My boyfriend (23m) is a dealer and won’t get a legal job what do

Hello everyone, I (22f) am having a hard time with my bf (23m). We have been together for almost 6 years, as the title states he is a dealer. I have been trying to encourage him to get a job for years, and he acts like a complete man child about it, he has a temper problem when it comes to any kind of authority over him. Other than that we really don’t get into disagreements so it makes this harder for me. When we started dating we only did it because it was what we had to do if we wanted food or shelter, but now he’s became lazy. He just wants fast easy ways to get rich (y’all don’t even know how many crypto scams I have prevented him from giving our savings to) and not put in effort for anything he wants in life. Obviously I can’t just change him and make him work, but idk what to do anymore and I’m tired of it. To make things worse I’m a very introverted person and don’t have any near friends I could just move in with if I decided to leave. I hate saying I’m with him only for financial reasons because I do really love him, but ultimately if I had the money I would have been gone long ago. He just keeps saying he’s going to get a job as an “entrepreneur” but as I said he wants everything handed to him with no effort.  Anyways what can or should I do?



Advice:

It sounds like you have been trying hard to encourage your boyfriend to get a legitimate job, and it sounds like he doesn't take the issue seriously. I think the first step is to have a serious discussion with him about his career and financial prospects. Make it clear that it is important for you both to have a stable source of income in order to plan for the future. Explain that getting a legal job is a necessary step for him to get to where he wants to be. If he is still resistant to the idea, then you need to think about what is best for your long-term goals. If leaving the relationship is something you would consider, then start putting together the resources and plan of action you would need to do so. In the meantime, it would be a good idea to talk with a counselor or a trusted friend to help you think through your options. It is okay to feel frustrated, but it might be helpful to discuss your thoughts with someone who is objective and can provide you with a different perspective.

Advice:

It sounds like you are in a challenging situation. It might be helpful to have a conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns and how his behavior and choices are affecting your relationship. You can try to approach the conversation from a place of concern and love for him, but also be firm in your expectations around what you need in the relationship.

My boyfriend (23m) is a dealer and won’t get a legal job what do

Hello everyone, I (22f) am having a hard time with my bf (23m). We have been together for almost 6 years, as the title states he is a dealer. I have been trying to encourage him to get a job for years, and he acts like a complete man child about it, he has a temper problem when it comes to any kind of authority over him. Other than that we really don’t get into disagreements so it makes this harder for me. When we started dating we only did it because it was what we had to do if we wanted food or shelter, but now he’s became lazy. He just wants fast easy ways to get rich (y’all don’t even know how many crypto scams I have prevented him from giving our savings to) and not put in effort for anything he wants in life. Obviously I can’t just change him and make him work, but idk what to do anymore and I’m tired of it. To make things worse I’m a very introverted person and don’t have any near friends I could just move in with if I decided to leave. I hate saying I’m with him only for financial reasons because I do really love him, but ultimately if I had the money I would have been gone long ago. He just keeps saying he’s going to get a job as an “entrepreneur” but as I said he wants everything handed to him with no effort.  Anyways what can or should I do?



Advice:

It sounds like you are in a challenging situation. It might be helpful to have a conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns and how his behavior and choices are affecting your relationship. You can try to approach the conversation from a place of concern and love for him, but also be firm in your expectations around what you need in the relationship.

Advice:

Firstly, acknowledge your conflict over your boyfriend's illegal job. The key to handling this is open, honest communication. Discuss your concerns and their effects on you and the relationship calmly. Be upfront about your feelings and expectations. Setting boundaries is also critical. Define what you can and can't tolerate, and ensure you stick to these. Be a positive influence, and inspire him to consider legal entrepreneurial pursuits or additional education, aiding him in finding resources if possible. Don't neglect your own needs. Evaluate your financial and emotional status. Consider getting a job for financial independence and, if needed, the option to exit the relationship. Consult a therapist or counselor if you're stuck or if the situation isn't improving. They could offer valuable advice and a way forward. Finally, prioritize your stability and safety. If your boyfriend's decisions continue to harm you and he's unwilling to change, reassess your relationship. You deserve a healthy, supportive, and secure relationship.

Ya, you’re an adult woman still hanging out with some kid you dated in high school. It’s time to change that. It’s nice that you love him and all but that’s not actually a basis for an adult relationship on its own. If it was, the divorce rate wouldn’t be so high. You need compatible goals, dreams and values and you two don’t have that. Your relationship has a hard end date and whether that’s today or a decade from now, this isn’t the man you’re going to decide to spend your life with. Do both of you a favor and go your separate ways. Move back in with your parents or find someplace cheap, but you need to end this.

Advice:

Based on the information provided, it's difficult to say exactly what went wrong. However, it's possible that the way you started the conversation with the girl over SnapChat may have made her uncomfortable. ""So what type stuff u into"" can come across as a bit forward or even potentially creepy, especially if you don't know someone very well. Additionally, it's possible that she could have changed her mind or simply lost interest for any number of reasons.



If you want to try to salvage the relationship, it might be a good idea to reflect on how you're coming across and consider starting with more light or friendly conversation next time. In general, it's best to try to get to know someone gradually and not put too much pressure on them to share personal information or move things forward too quickly.

So Prom was a few days ago and I starred talking to this girl and we rly got along and we’re genuinely having a good conversation and it was going well, one of her friends even came over and said they were going and she responded back to her friend “give me a few more minutes” and we continued talking for about 10 more minutes then Prom ended and I got her snap



We were snapping back and forth for a few days with just random pics then I texted her “Hey” and she texts back “Hi” and then asked her “So what type stuff u into” and then checked my phone a few minutes later and she had blocked me, ima need someone to explain what happened here because I clearly missed something, because I thought things were going pretty good and that we both liked each other



Advice:

Based on the information provided, it's difficult to say exactly what went wrong. However, it's possible that the way you started the conversation with the girl over SnapChat may have made her uncomfortable. ""So what type stuff u into"" can come across as a bit forward or even potentially creepy, especially if you don't know someone very well. Additionally, it's possible that she could have changed her mind or simply lost interest for any number of reasons.



If you want to try to salvage the relationship, it might be a good idea to reflect on how you're coming across and consider starting with more light or friendly conversation next time. In general, it's best to try to get to know someone gradually and not put too much pressure on them to share personal information or move things forward too quickly.

Advice:

A sudden halt in communication can be confusing and annoying. However, it's important to realize that many factors, many unrelated to you could affect one's behavior. There could be multiple reasons. She may have misinterpreted your question or found it too vague, leading to discomfort. External factors like personal problems or stress which are unrelated to you could be influencing her. Fear of commitment or getting close can cause people to pull away when they feel a bond forming. Influence from friends could also affect her decision to block you. Lastly, sometimes, people simply lose interest or change their minds without any clear reason. Even though it's natural to want to understand her actions, try not to take it personally. You can't control others' actions, and sometimes things don't work out as expected. Focus on moving forward and establishing relationships with those who share your interests and values.

My boyfriend of 8 months refuses to do anything most days besides playing video games

Me (25F) and my boyfriend (44M) refuses to do anything with me out in public most days and seems to think that eventually in time I’ll have to be responsible for all the household tasks and if we ever have kids I’ll have to be the sole provider so all he’ll have to do is pay bills and go to work. He does pay a majority of the bills because he does make more money. I think that we both need to split the needs of work in the house 50/50, I’ve mentioned to him before that it bothers me that we don’t do things together and he’ll usually come back with something like “ well we watched a movie together the other day” or “I’m trying to save money” even though he gets Amazon packages like everyday. Am I being unreasonable or annoying? Or is boyfriend the one who should step up?



Clarification:

I am not a mom I don’t have children, I don’t really have a desire to have children when America is the way it is. I’m all set. I am however am about to finish my first year of college and I work 30+ hours a week as an LNA. I don’t expect this to make anyone’s opinions change in the comments I just wanted to clarify I am not a mom. But I am one busy chick.



Advice:

It sounds like you are feeling very frustrated with your boyfriend's lack of engagement in activities you can do together. It is reasonable to expect that both people in a relationship should make an effort to spend time together and share in the responsibilities of the household. It does not sound like your boyfriend is making any effort to meet you halfway on this. It may be helpful to talk to him about how you are feeling and see if you can come to a resolution about how to better engage in shared activities. If he refuses to listen or make any changes, you may want to consider if the relationship is really worth the effort.

Advice:

You are not being unreasonable or annoying. It is important for both of you to have a healthy and balanced relationship where you both contribute equally, not just financially but also in terms of household tasks and spending quality time together outside of the house. Your boyfriend needs to understand that being in a relationship means compromise, effort, and making time for each other. It is not fair for him to expect you to take on all the household tasks and become the sole provider if you have children in the future.



I suggest having a serious and honest conversation with your boyfriend, expressing your concerns and expectations for the relationship, and coming up with a plan together that works for both of you. Additionally, it may be helpful to seek relationship counseling to work through any underlying issues and ensure that both of you are on the same page about the future of the relationship.

My boyfriend of 8 months refuses to do anything most days besides playing video games

Me (25F) and my boyfriend (44M) refuses to do anything with me out in public most days and seems to think that eventually in time I’ll have to be responsible for all the household tasks and if we ever have kids I’ll have to be the sole provider so all he’ll have to do is pay bills and go to work. He does pay a majority of the bills because he does make more money. I think that we both need to split the needs of work in the house 50/50, I’ve mentioned to him before that it bothers me that we don’t do things together and he’ll usually come back with something like “ well we watched a movie together the other day” or “I’m trying to save money” even though he gets Amazon packages like everyday. Am I being unreasonable or annoying? Or is boyfriend the one who should step up?



Clarification:

I am not a mom I don’t have children, I don’t really have a desire to have children when America is the way it is. I’m all set. I am however am about to finish my first year of college and I work 30+ hours a week as an LNA. I don’t expect this to make anyone’s opinions change in the comments I just wanted to clarify I am not a mom. But I am one busy chick.



Advice:

To address imbalance in a relationship, both partners need to communicate openly and commit to a balanced dynamic. If you feel ignored while your boyfriend spends lots of time gaming, express your feelings honestly and calmly. Emphasize the importance of shared household responsibility and quality time. Establish clear expectations and boundaries around responsibilities, finances, and leisure activities. Suggest enjoyable, affordable activities to strengthen your relationship. Discuss your finances and the necessity to balance savings with expenses. Urge your boyfriend to balance his gaming hobby with time spent with you by setting gaming and non-gaming times. If issues continue despite your efforts, consider couples counseling to aid conversations and provide insights on healthier dynamics. It's vital for both partners to contribute equally in a relationship and support each other. Communication is key, and the goal should always be a mutually agreeable solution.

Ask yourself why he can't date anyone his age. What self-respecting 44-year-old woman would date someone like this? Imagine being the sole provider for a 44-year-old man. This isn't fucking worth it. You don't have to be with this guy, even if you love him, sometimes dating is a test to see if someone is a life partner. Also good luck having kids with his biological clock. Do you want your children's father to be in his mid-70s when they're in college?

My 2nd grade son was involved in a scuffle at recess. Before I even heard anything of it from school, I received an email from the mother of one of the boys involved. At the end of it she threatened to file a police report.bPeople are absolutely insane these days but I laughed and dismissed her bizarre behavior. Didn't reply. Untill one night at 730, a knock on the door to reveal 2 armed patrol officers looking to interrogate my 7 year old son. This psycho really called the cops on a 2nd grader. I'm floored. I'm thinking about going with a Harassment or Restraining Order but what do you all think? If she is so mentally unstable as to call police on a 7 year old, what's she liable to do or say if she ever sees my son around school, for example, and I am not there?



Thoughts?



Advice:

Unfortunately, it seems that this mother is clearly unhinged and taking things to an extreme. The best thing to do would be to talk to the school first and make sure they are aware of the situation and that they are taking it seriously. If the school is not taking appropriate action, you may wish to consider a restraining or harassment order to protect your son. It is important to be proactive and take this seriously so that your son is protected from further harassment and intimidation from this mother. You should also address the matter with the police directly and see if they are willing to investigate the matter further.

I'm sorry to hear about your situation, and I can understand how you must be feeling. It's understandable that you would want to take action to protect your son and yourself from this person's erratic behavior. If you believe that this person is a threat to you or your son, and you feel unsafe, then seeking a restraining order may be a good idea. This can provide a legal barrier between you and this person, which may help you feel more secure. It's important to document everything that has happened so far, including the email, the visit from the police, and any other interactions you have had with this person. This documentation can help support your case if you do decide to seek legal action. It's also a good idea to speak with a lawyer, who can advise you on the best course of action. In the meantime, it may be helpful to have a conversation with your son about the importance of avoiding this person and seeking out a teacher or other authority figure if he ever feels uncomfortable or unsafe. This can help him feel empowered and give him tools to cope with the situation. Remember that you are not alone in dealing with difficult people like this. There are resources available to help you navigate this challenging situation.

Advice:

Your situation with your son is worrisome. Although I can't give legal advice, I can propose general steps. Start by discussing the incident and the other mother's response with your son's school. The staff might help mediate the situation. Keep a record of all interactions with the other mother. This could prove helpful in potential legal action or providing an account to the school. Despite provocation, stay calm and respectful towards the other mother to avoid escalation. If her behavior threatens your son or crosses boundaries, consider seeking legal guidance. Prioritize your son's feelings and experiences, encourage open dialogue about the incident, and give support. If things remain difficult, a mediation session with the other mother and a neutral third party might help. Remember to prioritize your son's well-being. By collaborating with the school, keeping composure, and possibly consulting with legal professionals, you can manage this tough situation.

My 2nd grade son was involved in a scuffle at recess. Before I even heard anything of it from school, I received an email from the mother of one of the boys involved. At the end of it she threatened to file a police report. People are absolutely insane these days but I laughed and dismissed her bizarre behavior. Didn't reply. Untill one night at 730, a knock on the door to reveal 2 armed patrol officers looking to interrogate my 7 year old son. This psycho really called the cops on a 2nd grader. I'm floored. I'm thinking about going with a Harassment or Restraining Order but what do you all think? If she is so mentally unstable as to call police on a 7 year old, what's she liable to do or say if she ever sees my son around school, for example, and I am not there?



Thoughts?



Advice:

Your situation with your son is worrisome. Although I can't give legal advice, I can propose general steps. Start by discussing the incident and the other mother's response with your son's school. The staff might help mediate the situation. Keep a record of all interactions with the other mother. This could prove helpful in potential legal action or providing an account to the school. Despite provocation, stay calm and respectful towards the other mother to avoid escalation. If her behavior threatens your son or crosses boundaries, consider seeking legal guidance. Prioritize your son's feelings and experiences, encourage open dialogue about the incident, and give support. If things remain difficult, a mediation session with the other mother and a neutral third party might help. Remember to prioritize your son's well-being. By collaborating with the school, keeping composure, and possibly consulting with legal professionals, you can manage this tough situation.

Advice:

This is a matter for school administration since it happened during recess. Make an appointment with the admin to discuss the next steps. Usually if police are involved they will contact the school. I'm surprised you haven't heard from the school. The thing is schools easily label kids and sometimes those labels affect how they are dealt with going forward. You will want to get their take on the event. It will give you a good idea of how they viewed and recorded the event. Don't escalate. Investigate.

Advice:

I'm sorry to hear about your dad's diagnosis. It's great that you and your mom are looking for ways to make his remaining time enjoyable. Here are a few ideas to consider. Firstly, planning a family vacation could be a wonderful way to create lasting memories. Choose a destination that your dad has always wanted to visit and make sure it is wheelchair-friendly and accessible. This way, he can fully enjoy everything that the trip has to offer. Another idea is to host a family game night. Gather some of your dad's favorite games, whether it's cards or board games, and have a fun night together. Get some snacks, drinks, and maybe even some prizes to make it extra enjoyable. Creating a photo album or scrapbook can be a heartfelt and meaningful activity. Go through old family photos or take new ones, and compile them into an album that your dad can treasure and look through whenever he wants. If your dad enjoys movies, having a movie marathon day could be a great option. Pick some of his favorite films and spend the day watching them together. Make sure to have plenty of snacks and drinks to make it a cozy and enjoyable experience. Lastly, consider bringing your dad's favorite restaurant to him if he can no longer go out to eat. Order takeout from his preferred place or cook his favorite meal at home to create a special dining experience. Above all, remember that the most important thing is to spend quality time with your dad and make him feel loved and supported. These activities can provide enjoyable and memorable moments, but the key is to cherish each moment you have together.

Advice:

I'm sorry to learn about your father's condition. It's admirable that you and your mom are seeking enjoyable activities for the three of you. Here are some suggestions keeping in mind his health. Movie nights could be comforting where you can watch his favorite films or discover new ones, perhaps with blankets, pillows, and snacks. Board games or puzzles could keep his mind active while providing family bonding. Storytelling sessions about past memories or favorite moments can foster deep connections. Engaging in arts, like painting, might kindle creativity and sense of achievement. Listening to music or audiobooks can be both soothing and engaging. Gentle exercises like chair yoga or tai chi can help maintain his flexibility. Consider low-impact outdoor activities, like short walks or scenic drives. Involving your father in cooking his favorite dishes can be enjoyable. Video calls with friends and family can keep him socially active. Collaborating on a memory book could create a valuable keepsake. Remember to be patient and understanding, cherishing the moments you share together.️

Advice:

My mother had ALS. Chances are, you can expect the following to happen:



Your dad is going to lose his ability to communicate (or at least to communicate without difficulty) at some point.  Use this time now to get him to tell his stories, and record them so that you can write them down for his grandkids to enjoy. Your dad is going to lose his ability to swallow, and will eventually need a feeding tube.  So cook what he loves, take him out to restaurants he loves, and order in food he loves, while you can. Your dad is going to lose his mobility, and navigating the world in a wheelchair (especially a power chair, which he is likely going to eventually need) is anything but easy.  So if there are places he likes to go, do it now while you still can.  Your dad is going to tire easily and anything you plan for his needs to account for that.

Your dad is going to lose his ability to swallow, and will eventually need a feeding tube.  So cook what he loves, take him out to restaurants he loves, and order in food he loves, while you can. Your dad is going to lose his mobility, and navigating the world in a wheelchair (especially a power chair, which he is likely going to eventually need) is anything but easy.  So if there are places he likes to go, do it now while you still can.  Your dad is going to tire easily and anything you plan for his needs to account for that.

Why am I still disgusted with my boyfriend

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for three years now. Honestly when we met I wasn’t looking for a relationship, and I don’t think he was either.

So when we first met I saw him and I felt disgusted. This overwhelming feeling of disgust…

I ignored it then, as we’d only just met, but to this day it’s still there.

There’s things I’ve grown to love about him, but still underneath this feeling of disgust is there.

Why do I feel this way?



Advice:

It is possible that this feeling of disgust comes from unresolved issues you have with yourself. For example, you may be projecting feelings of low self-worth onto this relationship, subconsciously believing that you don’t deserve someone better or that you don’t deserve to be in a healthy, loving relationship.

It’s also possible that you are being influenced by insecurities from past relationships, if you have any. Furthermore, this feeling of disgust could be due to a traumatic experience in your past that has impacted the way you view relationships and/or intimate connections.

Our emotions can often be mysterious and difficult to decipher. It is possible that in order to get to the bottom of your feelings and make sense of them, you may need to seek the assistance of a professional. Counseling or psychotherapy can be a great way to explore and understand your feelings and identify any underlying issues that could be causing them.

Advice:

It's difficult to say for sure without more information, but it's possible that you could be experiencing something called ""disgust sensitivity."" This is a common and natural response to things that we perceive as unsanitary, dangerous, or generally unappealing. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including personal experiences, cultural influences, and even genetics. In the case of your relationship, it's possible that something about your boyfriend triggers this response in you. It could be a physical trait, a habit or behavior, or even something about his personality. It's important to explore these feelings and try to pinpoint what specifically is causing you to feel this way. Keep in mind that feeling disgusted does not necessarily mean that your relationship is doomed. Many couples have differences or annoyances that they learn to work through and overcome. However, if the feeling persists and is impacting your ability to have a healthy relationship, it may be worth seeking the help of a therapist or counselor to explore your feelings more deeply.

Advice:

Identifying the cause of your disgust for your boyfriend without more context is difficult. Several possibilities could explain this. One is that your first impression about him still affects your emotions. Also, despite your three-year relationship, certain incompatibilities might trigger these feelings. Feelings of disgust may also act as a defense mechanism in a relationship. Unresolved issues within your relationship could also be a cause. It's important to address any conflicts or communication issues you might have. To better understand and manage your feelings, you may want to consult a mental health professional. Open conversations with your boyfriend about your feelings can improve your understanding and connection.

My mom has been crying and is devastated since I moved out what do I do?

I grew up with a single mom and for a while was my only guardian before my dad came back to be part of my life. Where very close and to her it’s just me in her family. I decided I wanted to move out for college with a friend and get an apartment in the city but since then my mom has been torn and never even wanted me to move out in the first place. She’s lived alone since and said how much she miss me and wants me to move back in but today she called and was crying on the phone how lonely she is and how afraid she is and wants me to consider moving back in when my lease is up though I’ve been planning for me and my gf to then move in which again she’s not fond of. I visit her each week between school and work but she’s still sad. What do I do, I don’t like my mom being so lonely and sad but then again I’m almost 20 and should live my own life?



Advice:

It sounds like you have a very close relationship with your mom, and it must be difficult to see her so upset. It's understandable that you want to live your own life and have your own independence, but it's important to consider your mother's feelings and emotions. One thing you could do is have a conversation with your mom about it and try to come up with a solution that is mutually beneficial. Explain to her that you still want to live your own life, but also have some way to make her feel more connected to you. Perhaps you can offer to video call her every week, or maybe you could take her out on special occasions or plan regular mother-daughter weekends. It's also possible that she just needs some extra assurance that you still love her and that you won't forget about her even though you don't live in the same house. It's important to be patient and understanding as you talk to your mom and work out a solution that works for both of you.

Advice:

It is understandable that you feel conflicted about your mom's sadness but also want to live your own life. It sounds like your mom may be experiencing empty nest syndrome, which is a common feeling for parents when their children move out. You can have an open and honest conversation with your mom and express your love and concern for her, but also let her know that it's important for you to have your own life and independence. You can reassure her that you will still visit and keep in touch regularly. You can also suggest activities or hobbies for her to do that can help her feel less lonely and more engaged. Encourage her to connect with her own friends or family members for support, and to seek professional help if she feels overwhelmed. It's important to remember that you are not responsible for your mom's happiness, but you can be supportive and understanding. Ultimately, you have to make the best decision for yourself and your future, and your mom will eventually have to adjust to this new phase in both of your lives.

I visit her each week between school and work but she’s still sad. What do I do, I don’t like my mom being so lonely and sad but then again I’m almost 20 and should live my own life?



Advice:

It is understandable that you feel conflicted about your mom's sadness but also want to live your own life. It sounds like your mom may be experiencing empty nest syndrome, which is a common feeling for parents when their children move out. You can have an open and honest conversation with your mom and express your love and concern for her, but also let her know that it's important for you to have your own life and independence. You can reassure her that you will still visit and keep in touch regularly. You can also suggest activities or hobbies for her to do that can help her feel less lonely and more engaged. Encourage her to connect with her own friends or family members for support, and to seek professional help if she feels overwhelmed. It's important to remember that you are not responsible for your mom's happiness, but you can be supportive and understanding. Ultimately, you have to make the best decision for yourself and your future, and your mom will eventually have to adjust to this new phase in both of your lives.

Advice:

Balancing your mother's well-being with your growing independence can be complex but manageable. Begin by discussing your feelings and ambitions clearly while also understanding and acknowledging her loneliness. Help her combat this by developing a wider social circle through activities or reaching out to friends. Regular contact with her can also make her feel connected and reassure her that your stepping into independence isn't abandonment. If her feelings of sadness persist, professional counselling may be beneficial. Don't neglect your own needs, too. Remember, your future plans, including cohabitation with your girlfriend, shouldn't be compromised. Striking a balance between supporting your mother and moving ahead in life is vital. You can do this through open communication, encouraging her social interactions, and maintaining regular contact.

Your mom needs therapy. I can understand being lonely but the whole point of being a parent is getting your child to the point where they can be independent. Everyone has to deal with being alone at some point. Even if you lived with just her your whole life, one day she will die and then the roles are reversed. You visit her every week. I don’t even hang out with certain friends that often. You shouldn’t change anything you’re doing because of her. She’s the one who’s going to have to learn to cope with her empty nest syndrome. If I were you I’d gently recommend counseling, but don’t try to compromise any more than you have been. You’ll just be stunting your own growth.

Are any teen moms, dads, or parents, in general, able to advise me on caring for a baby at 16?

# I got my girlfriend pregnant and she doesn't want an abortion but neither do I. Im gonna be 16 in about 2 weeks so I can get a decent amount of jobs but pretty low pay. I don't know how my mom is going to react, she could kick me out but I'm not sure. Would it be better to move in with my GF and care for the baby or stay with my mom?

Advice:

 It is recommended to talk to your family and your girlfriend to find the best solution. There are many support networks available for teen parents, such as parenting classes and support groups. Talk to your healthcare provider or local family doctor for referrals. There are also a variety of online resources that can provide helpful advice and tips for teen parents, such as The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and the March of Dimes. It is important to start preparing now by learning about parenting skills and understanding the responsibilities involved in caring for a baby. Make sure to look into financial support and assistance, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Additionally, it will be helpful to start gathering the supplies and items needed for a baby beforehand. Make a list of things you may need, such as clothing, diapers, baby wipes and items for the baby's room. It is also important to build a support system of family and friends who can help you through this transition. Good luck!

Advice:

First of all, it’s important to understand that caring for a baby is a huge responsibility that requires a lot of time, effort, and resources. Teen parenthood can be challenging, but with support, education, and dedication, it is possible to do it successfully. Regarding whether it would be better to move in with your girlfriend or stay with your mom, there are several factors to consider. It’s important to talk openly with your girlfriend and your mom about your options and their feelings. Living with your girlfriend may provide more privacy and autonomy, but it may also come with additional expenses and responsibilities. Living with your mom may offer more stability and support, but it may also require compromise and communication about your new role as a parent.



When it comes to what you need for a baby, some essential items include:

- Diapers

- Wipes

- Clothing (onesies, sleepers, socks, hats, etc.)

- Bottles and formula (if not breastfeeding)

- A car seat

- A crib or bassinet

- A stroller

- Baby bath tub

- Baby monitor



Additionally, it’s important to have resources for medical care, such as a pediatrician and health insurance.

It’s also important to note that there are many community resources available for young parents, such as parenting classes, support groups, and financial assistance programs. Do some research and see what resources are available in your area. Remember that it’s okay to ask for help, and that being a good parent means putting the needs of your child first. Take care of yourself, your girlfriend, and your baby, and don’t be afraid to reach out for support.

First of all, it’s important to understand that caring for a baby is a huge responsibility that requires a lot of time, effort, and resources. Teen parenthood can be challenging, but with support, education, and dedication, it is possible to do it successfully. Regarding whether it would be better to move in with your girlfriend or stay with your mom, there are several factors to consider. It’s important to talk openly with your girlfriend and your mom about your options and their feelings. Living with your girlfriend may provide more privacy and autonomy, but it may also come with additional expenses and responsibilities. Living with your mom may offer more stability and support, but it may also require compromise and communication about your new role as a parent.



When it comes to what you need for a baby, some essential items include:

- Diapers

- Wipes

- Clothing (onesies, sleepers, socks, hats, etc.)

- Bottles and formula (if not breastfeeding)

- A car seat

- A crib or bassinet

- A stroller

- Baby bath tub

- Baby monitor



Additionally, it’s important to have resources for medical care, such as a pediatrician and health insurance.

It’s also important to note that there are many community resources available for young parents, such as parenting classes, support groups, and financial assistance programs. Do some research and see what resources are available in your area. Remember that it’s okay to ask for help, and that being a good parent means putting the needs of your child first. Take care of yourself, your girlfriend, and your baby, and don’t be afraid to reach out for support.

Are any teen moms, dads, or parents, in general, able to advise me on caring for a baby at 16?

# I got my girlfriend pregnant and she doesn't want an abortion but neither do I. Im gonna be 16 in about 2 weeks so I can get a decent amount of jobs but pretty low pay. I don't know how my mom is going to react, she could kick me out but I'm not sure. Would it be better to move in with my GF and care for the baby or stay with my mom? I also need help knowing what I need for a baby.



Advice:

Even if I can't personally relate to your teen parent situation, I can advise on how to adjust to this life change and make informed decisions. Start by having open communication with both sets of parents- this can facilitate discussions about your fears, explore options, and garner their support. They can offer insightful guidance in this journey. Consider where you will live. This depends on family dynamics and available resources. The place needs to be stable and supportive for your baby and you. Parenting is challenging, hence the need to learn about baby care from books, parenting classes, consultations, or online sources.


Financial readiness is key. Babies are costly; budget for essentials, medical costs, childcare. Consider cost-saving options like buying used items or borrowing baby gear. Regular prenatal care for your girlfriend during pregnancy is a must. This ensures the health of her and the baby, and provides many resources. Prepare the essential items like clothing, diapers, a bassinet, blankets, bottles, and a car seat. As the baby grows, think about additional necessities. Building support networks of friends, family, and healthcare professionals is vital, as well as seeking help from local community organizations or young parent support groups. While your baby should be a priority, don't abandon your education and career goals to ensure a secure future. Remember, each situation is unique; make decisions based on your circumstances and resources. Don't shy away from asking for help from trusted adults, healthcare professionals, and other resources.

Advice:

I'm 30 now. But when I was 17 my girlfriend and I got pregnant. We opted for adoption, my father knew of a couple who wanted but couldn't have kids. They were super awesome, well-off, amazing jobs. Needless to say the kid was going to be set, better off than I ever was and I was raised middle class. They paid for all the hospital expenses, pampered her, and let us stay at their house. It was the best option for us at the time, cause neither of us felt right getting an abortion, but knew we weren't ready to be parents. Flash forward to now, that girl and I broke up more than a decade ago, good riddance honestly. I met my NOW wife a few years after the breakup, we have two boys, and life is good. Parenting is hard, I do not regret what we did and the choices we made. The way our relationship went after the adoption was horrible. She cheated, manipulated, tormented. The true colors showed once we were out of high school and got to experience the real world. Just weigh your options man, and think about your future self. Good luck and hope you the best.

Is it ok to walk away?



Yesterday I was wearing a pullover of my favorite baseball team. At the grocery store. Doing my thing. Minding my business.

This man, a creepy squirrelly type, starts talking to me about the team. He makes zero sense. I can barely understand him and I’m trying to be polite and saying mmmhmm and walk away. Again. I don’t know him. I think that’s generous. But, he turns his cart around and starts following me to talk more. I end up turning again, because … I don’t care to continue this conversation because I feel he’s being a little racist. But, I feel he’s taken advantage of my being nice. He approaches again an aisle over and continues, at this point, I try an uh-huh and walk off.



In this situation, is it ok to walk off? I don’t know this person. He’s a little on the creeper side. I don’t want trouble. I was just minding my business, shopping.



Advice:

Yes, it is completely ok to walk away! You were minding your own business and you can choose not to engage in conversations you aren't comfortable with. No one should ever make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable and it is important to trust your gut if you feel like something isn't right or if someone is making you feel uncomfortable. You have every right to politely excuse yourself and walk away.

I end up turning again, because … I don’t care to continue this conversation because I feel he’s being a little racist. But, I feel he’s taken advantage of my being nice. He approaches again an aisle over and continues, at this point, I try an uh-huh and walk off.



In this situation, is it ok to walk off? I don’t know this person. He’s a little on the creeper side. I don’t want trouble. I was just minding my business, shopping.



Advice:

Sure, it's alright to leave if you're uncomfortable. Your safety and comfort matter. If someone makes you uneasy, you're entitled to exit the situation. Trust your instincts and prioritize your health. You don't owe anyone your time or attention, especially if they cross personal boundaries. If harassment continues, seek help from store staff or security.

Yes, perfectly fine. Also it would be okay for you to be firm and straight up tell him to please leave you alone. Men can sometimes be persistent unless their directly told to go pound rocks.
